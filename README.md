### 2. Stores Dashboard
Deep dives into operational efficiency across locations:
* #### Market Leadership: Hell's Kitchen leads in both revenue ($236.5K) and order volume.

### 3. Products Dashboard
Focuses on category-level performance and portfolio optimization:
* #### Category Performance: A dual-axis analysis comparing Sales Revenue vs. Transaction Quantity across all categories. This highlights that while Coffee and Tea drive the highest volume, other categories contribute differently to the bottom line.
* #### Top % Up & Down: Identifies specific products with the most significant growth or decline in sales, such as Brewed Chai tea (+26,250) vs. Green beans (only 134 units).
* #### Portfolio Positioning: Features a Bubble Chart analyzing the correlation between Quantity, AOV (Average Order Value), and Total Revenue to classify products into strategic groups.

## 💡 Business Insights & Recommendations
Based on the data, the following strategic insights were identified:
#### 1. Cross-selling Opportunity: The Bakery category has consistent revenue ($82K) but a lower AOV ($3.61). Implementing "Coffee + Bakery" bundles could effectively increase the overall AOV.
#### 2. High-Value Potential: "Coffee Beans" boast the highest AOV at $22.87, yet sales volume is low (1,828 units). Increasing marketing efforts for home-brewing customers could significantly boost profit margins.
#### 3. Portfolio Positioning: Using Bubble Chart analysis, products are classified into "Volume Drivers" (Coffee/Tea) and "Premium Niches" (Beans/Branded), allowing for targeted marketing strategies.
